####Assignment
For this assignment we were given skeleton code that included methods for innitiating and playing through the maze game. we were then given guidance on what was missin g to set up the Deep Q reinforced learning problem. 

####Learning
Computer scientists take large scale problems and convert them into computer code for processing and evaluation. They also design and maintain systems and networks. There is a lot that goes into these processes but as it applies to artificial intelligence they build the foundational blocks that allow the computer to learn and improve. To aproach a problem as a computer scientists it is best to first break it down into requirements then to analyze the correct systems and tools to conquer the task and finally to develop being sure to test and execute. My ethical responsabilities are to ensure that nothing violates a users trust or security with the products I develop. That includes eliminating bias so that the code that is being executed is fair for everyone.
